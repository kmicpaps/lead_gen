icebreaker tempalte: Read your LinkedIn about "{li_summary_snippet}" and saw the {case_study_title} case study on the {casual company name} site. Caught my eye, decided to reach out.

## Subject Line 

```
{{firstName}}, your best client deserves a better lead magnet

---

## Body A

```
{{icebreaker}} 

I’m {{sender_name}}. I help PPC agencies turn their “download the guide” pages into small AI apps that convert better. Same traffic, but a lead magnet that actually reacts to the user instead of handing them a static PDF.

I’ll ship a branded AI lead magnet for one of your current campaigns in under 72 hours that’s built to generate 30%+ more sign ups from the same ad spend in the first 10 days, and you only pay if it actually beats your current numbers.

I've spent 2+ years building these systems ({{sender_company}} is my shop), and I document the process on YouTube (@YourChannel) so people can see the actual work.

If you want a concrete example mocked up for one of your clients, reply “example” and tell me which offer you’d plug this into. If now’s not the time, reply “no” and I’ll get out of your inbox.

## Body B
{{icebreaker}}

I’m {{sender_name}}. I work with PPC agencies who are great at getting the right clicks, but most of those clicks still hit the same “download the guide” page they launched years ago.

I build small AI lead magnet apps that react to the user—things like “drop in your URL and get tailored ad angles or a quick score”—so the lead magnet feels like a mini product, not a form.

I’ll ship a branded AI lead magnet for one of your current campaigns in under 72 hours that’s built to generate 30%+ more sign ups from the same ad spend in the first 10 days, and you only pay if it actually beats your current numbers.

Under {{sender_company}}, I've been building these systems for agencies for years, , and I document the process on YouTube (@YourChannel) so people can see the actual work.

If you want to see what that would look like for one specific client or offer, reply “example” and tell me which account you’d test first. If now’s not the time, reply “no” and I’ll close the loop.

Quick follow-up on the AI lead magnet idea.

Right now you’re probably sending cold traffic to a static form or PDF. The easiest win usually isn’t a new channel, it’s making the thing they land on actually interesting and personalized.

Last email from me on this.

If you’re curious how I use this for my own funnel, you can also try my AI lead magnet idea generator here: [Lead magnet ideas tool link]. It’ll spit out a few “not boring” lead magnet concepts based on your offer.

If you want the test plan, reply “yes” and I’ll map it out for one specific funnel. If not, reply “no” and I’ll delete you from my list.

No hard feelings either way.
