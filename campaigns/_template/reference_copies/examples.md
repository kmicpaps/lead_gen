Hi {{first_name}},

{{icebreaker}}

I work with marketing teams who are tired of watching their ad spend disappear into campaigns that don't convert.

We've helped companies like yours cut wasted spend by 30-40% while actually increasing qualified leads.

Would it make sense to chat for 15 minutes this week?

Best,

I noticed {{company}} is investing in paid advertising. Quick question: are you happy with your cost per lead?

We specialize in Google Ads optimization for companies in your space. Our average client sees a 35% reduction in CPL within 60 days.

Re: Quick question about {{company}}
```

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Just circling back on my last email.

I wanted to share a quick win we had with a similar company in {{industry}}:

They were spending $15K/month on Google Ads but only getting 40 qualified leads. We restructured their campaigns and within 8 weeks they were getting 85+ leads at the same spend.

Would love to explore if we could get similar results for {{company}}.

15 minutes this week?

{{sender_name}}
```

Adds specific case study with numbers, re-states CTA.

### Subject Line

Re: Quick question about {{company}}
```

### Body

```
Hi {{first_name}},

One more thought before I stop bothering you.

We just finished a campaign for [Client Name] in {{industry}} where we:
- Reduced their cost per acquisition by 42%
- Increased conversion rate from 2.1% to 4.8%
- All within 90 days

I genuinely think we could get {{company}} similar results based on what I've seen.

If you're even slightly curious, let's do a quick 15-minute call. If it's not a fit, I'll be the first to tell you.

{{sender_name}}

```
Quick question
```

### Body

```
{{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times - just want to make sure I'm not missing something.

Is improving your paid ad performance not a priority right now?

Or maybe you've got it handled internally?

Either way, just let me know and I'll update my notes.

{{sender_name}}
```

Here's a quick checklist we use internally to audit Google Ads accounts: [link]

No strings attached - use it however you want.

If you ever want to chat about your campaigns, you know where to find me.

```

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back.

I totally get it - you're busy and this might not be the right time.

I'm going to assume improving ad performance isn't a priority for {{company}} right now and close out your file.

If anything changes down the road, feel free to reach out. I'll be here.

All the best,

No hard feelings - I'll stop filling up your inbox.

If you ever want to chat about cutting your ad costs, just reply to this email. I'll still be here.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. - If you've been ignoring me because my emails are terrible, I'd genuinely appreciate the feedback.
