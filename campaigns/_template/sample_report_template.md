## 4. Email Sequence Template

### Email 1: Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** Quick question about {{company}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

{{icebreaker}}

I work with marketing leaders who are tired of watching their ad spend disappear into campaigns that don't convert.

We've helped companies like {{company}} reduce their cost per lead by 35-40% while increasing qualified pipeline.

Would it make sense to chat for 15 minutes this week?

Best,
{{sender_name}}
```

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about {{company}}

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Just following up on my previous note.

I wanted to share a quick win we had with a similar company in {{industry}}: they were spending $20K/month on paid ads but only seeing 50 qualified leads. We restructured their campaigns and within 8 weeks they were getting 120+ leads at the same spend.

Would love to explore if we could get similar results for {{company}}.

15 minutes this week?

{{sender_name}}
```

### Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times and haven't heard back - I totally get it, you're busy.

I'm going to assume this isn't a priority for {{company}} right now and close out your file.

If things change down the road, feel free to reach out. I'll be here.

All the best,
{{sender_name}}
```

## 5. Personalized Sample Emails

### For John Smith (TechCorp)

**Subject:** Quick question about TechCorp's new analytics platform

```
Hi John,

I noticed TechCorp just launched v2.0 of your analytics platform - the real-time dashboard features caught my eye. Impressive work.

With your background scaling growth at HubSpot, I imagine you know better than most how important it is to get the most out of every marketing dollar.

We help B2B SaaS companies like TechCorp reduce their cost per lead by 35-40% through optimized paid campaigns. Would love to share how we did this for [similar company].

Worth a quick chat?

Best,
[Sender]
```

### For Sarah Johnson (DataFlow)

**Subject:** Sarah - idea for DataFlow's growth

```
Hi Sarah,

Congrats on the Series B - scaling from Segment to building DataFlow's marketing engine is no small feat.

As you ramp up growth post-funding, I imagine efficient customer acquisition is top of mind.

We specialize in helping data infrastructure companies like DataFlow optimize their paid campaigns. Our average client sees a 40% reduction in CAC within 60 days.

Would it make sense to chat for 15 minutes about what we're seeing work in the space?

Best,
[Sender]
```
